Hello ! In this project, I implemented a simple principle of working with clients who can book any service for a certain time.
To start my project locally you need write some simple commands:

1. python3 -m venv env
2. source env/bin/activate (Windows : venv/Scripts/activate)
3. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
4. python3 manage.py migrate
5. python3 manage.py runserver

If you want to create more data just login by this superuser data :
username : admin
password: admin 

  In .env.sample you have 3 variables : 
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY ( need to stripe payment work fine ),
- STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET ( need to handle request payment ),
- SECRET_KEY ( that`s your djando secret key to run project ),

To make payment through Stripe work for you:
1. You need to register here : https://dashboard.stripe.com/login_success?redirect=%2F
2. Get your secret and public api keys
3. Configure the Stripe request handler (webhook)  how to do it is described here: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install
4. Here is full tutorial if you got problems : https://testdriven.io/blog/django-stripe-tutorial/
5. IMPORTANT! Paste your stripe keys and SECRET_KEY (that`s your djando secret key to run project ) into settings or .env.sample file to load secret information from AND RENAME FILE TO .env !
